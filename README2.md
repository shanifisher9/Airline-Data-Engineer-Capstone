Data Engineering Capstone
Throughout the year there have been many challenges due to COVID-19 and many business/industries got affected. One industry was the transportation industry and I was curious to learn more about the industry and how things work. Therefore, I decided that I wanted to create a data warehouse of all information about flights and specifically during this time period. There wasn't a lot information that openly available but I found some. Additionally, I though it would be interesting to lookg at the data of other methods of transportation and how they got got affected but I wasn't able to find that data in the time I had but hoping collect that information in the future. Once all of this data is together in a data warehouse it would be really easy to analyse and see how the transportation industry is doing and coping with these new changes.Â¶
